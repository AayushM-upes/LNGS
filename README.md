# LOCALISATION OF NODES IN A GEOGRAPHICAL SPAN

## Objectives of the Project
- [ ] Generating random or user generated graph which serve as a reference of a Geo-location with vector weights and optimizing those vector weight parameter because in real life multiple factors affect commute on a particular path like distance and congestion.
- [ ] Applying Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest path in a network using the optimised weights from the above step because Dijkstra is not designed to work on vector weights.
